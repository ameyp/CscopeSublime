# Cscope
A plugin to use Cscope for code navigation from inside Sublime Text 2 and 3.

## Features
This plugin supports the majority of the functionality offered by Cscope, namely:

1. Find a given symbol
2. Find a given function definition
3. Find functions called by a given function
4. Find functions calling a given function
5. Find a given text string
6. Find a given egrep pattern
7. Find a given file
8. Find files #including a given file

## Installation
1. Install Cscope (a Windows port can be found [here](http://code.google.com/p/cscope-win32))
2. Add the cscope binary path to the .settings file, if needed.
3. Generate a cscope database (cscope.out) in the root directory of your project
4. Check out the repo under your "Packages" directory or install via [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) and restart Sublime Text.

## Screenshots
Here's what the symbol lookup results buffer looks like:

## Configuration
If you wish to change the way CscopeSublime behaves, you have two options:

1. Modify the corresponding setting in the default CscopeSublime.sublime-settings file in the package's directory
2. Add a setting in your `Settings - User` file prefixed with `CscopeSublime_`.
   For example, to modify the `display_outline` setting and set it to `false`, put the line `"CscopeSublime_display_outline": false` in your settings file.

## Keybindings

- `Ctrl/Super + \`                 - Show Cscope options
- `Ctrl/Super + L``Ctrl/Super + S` - Look up symbol under cursor
- `Ctrl/Super + L``Ctrl/Super + D` - Look up definition under cursor
- `Ctrl/Super + L``Ctrl/Super + E` - Look up functions called by the function under the cursor
- `Ctrl/Super + L``Ctrl/Super + R` - Look up functions calling the function under the cursor
- `Ctrl/Super + Shift + [`         - Jump back
- `Ctrl/Super + Shift + ]`         - Jump forward

## Notes
The plugin will recursively search for the cscope database in parent directories of the currently open file until it either finds the database or reaches the root directory.
